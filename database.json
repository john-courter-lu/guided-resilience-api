Losing a job can be a big blow to one's self-esteem and confidence, which might also be contributing to your feelings of shame and helplessness.\n\nIt's important to remember that you're not alone in this. While it might feel like you have no one to turn to right now, reaching out for support is a positive step. Talking about your feelings and experiences can be very therapeutic. If you're open to it, we can work together to explore your emotions, coping strategies, and ways to move forward.\n\nTake a deep breath and know that we're here to work through this together. You're stronger than you realize, and with time and support, you can navigate through these challenging feelings. Let's start by unpacking your emotions and finding some ways to help you cope.",
